# SNU Library Noise Monitor

## Domain: Smart Buildings
This project serves to help to make the library noise-free. Since it uses wireless sensor networking capabilities to interact with the building and automate a task, we think it justifies the `Smart Buildings` category.

## Objective:
The objective of this project is to actively monitor noise level inside the library. We are using a Sound Sensor with ESP8266 (Wifi Module) to monitor noise levels in the library. We aggregate the sensor data every 15 seconds and if it crosses the threshold level, we trigger an SMS to the guard's mobile phone present in the library.

## Discuss 2-3 real world applications of the project:
We have made our project as a real word application which can be used on our university's campus. Apart from this, this project can be used in areas like schools, hospitals and other buildings where silence has to be maintained. 
Multiple arduino boards can be set up in the building where each can measure the noise levels and notify the nearest concerned authority.
